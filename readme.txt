Meet Kevin, your personal planner!

When you run Kevin, he'll greet you and ask you for your name like a civilized chatbot. Tell him what you have planned (like 'meeting at three') and he'll add it to your calendar.
If he asks you a yes or no question, answer 'yes' or 'no' (not just 'y' or 'n') because he doesn't understand slang.

If you want to see what events you've made, type 'display'.
If you want to update an event you have already created, type 'update'.
If you want to cancel an event, type 'cancel' and you'll be subsequently asked which event you want to remove.

How to tell Kevin the time of your event:
  Write time in HH:MM format followed by a space & "AM" or "PM"
    ex. "07:00 PM"
  Months and days of the week must be spelled out completely
    ex. "April" or "Saturday"
  It's not necessary to tell Kevin everything! Give whatever details you want to Kevin & if he needs more information, he'll ask you!

Kevin isn't the brightest right now, but he's working on it.
He still has a little trouble picking up locations, but the event list part, he has got down!

Example inputs:
  "Meeting tomorrow"
  "Movie night Thursday at 06:00 PM"
  "Exam on April 27 at 11:30 AM"

How to make sure Kevin gets your event location:
	You must use the word “at”
	Location can only be one word.
