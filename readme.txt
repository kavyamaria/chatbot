Meet Kevin, your personal planner!

When you run Kevin, he'll greet you. Tell him what you have planned (like 'meeting at three') and he'll add it to your calendar.
If he asks you a yes or no question, answer 'yes' or 'no' (not just 'y' or 'n') because he doesn't understand slang.

If you want to see what events you've made, type 'display'.
If you want to cancel an event, type 'cancel' and you'll be subsequently asked which event you want to remove.

Kevin isn't the brightest right now, but he's working on it.
He still has a little trouble picking up dates & locations, but the event list part, he has got down!
