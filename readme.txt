Meet Kevin, your personal planner!

When you run Kevin, he'll greet you and ask you for your name like a civilized chatbot. Tell him what you have planned (like 'meeting at 03:00 PM') and he'll add it to your calendar.
If he asks you a yes or no question, answer 'yes' or 'no' (not just 'y' or 'n') because he doesn't understand slang.

If you want to see what events you've made, type 'display'.
If you want to update an event you have already created, type 'update'.
If you want to cancel an event, type 'cancel' and you'll be subsequently asked which event you want to remove.

In order for Kevin to understand your input as an event, some time-related phrase must be included like 'tomorrow' or 'at 04:30 PM'.

How to tell Kevin the time of your event:
  Write time in HH:MM format followed by a space & "AM" or "PM"
    ex. "07:00 PM"
  Months and days of the week must be spelled out completely
    ex. "April" or "Saturday" (he does not understand 04/27/2017!)
    
How to make sure Kevin gets your event location:
  You must use the word “at”
  Location can only be one word.
  Location cannot contain apostrophes    
    
It's not necessary to tell Kevin everything! Give whatever details you want to Kevin & if he needs more information, he'll ask you!

Example inputs:
  "Meeting tomorrow at Starbucks"
  "date night thursday at 06:00 PM with joe jonas"
  "Physics exam on April 27 at 11:30 AM at Loomis"
